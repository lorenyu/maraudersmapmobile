Compatibility Issues
====================

Differences between emulator and S60 devices
-------------------------------------------- 
- Camera features are not supported.
- With some Bluetooth adapters there are problems in using certain 
  physical COM-ports for Bluetooth adapter with the emulator.
  
  Workaround: Try different COM-port for the adapter.

Known Issues
============

Installation/Uninstallation
---------------------------
- It is recommended that JDK and IDE are installed before
  installing the SDK.
- The SDK installation path should contain only alphanumeric
  characters. Currently, the installer allows selecting a path which 
  contains spaces, but the functionality of a SDK installed to such path 
  may fail.
- Installation/uninstallation of the SDK requires local admin rights.

Emulator
--------
- The emulator includes most of the S60 applications for convenience.
  The lack of the actual terminal hardware limits availability of
  some features like SIM features.
- The emulated MMC card should be initialized with Memory Application 
  before first use.
- In MMC Emulation, removable drive letter is not always updated in
  configuration panel.
- When opening DRM content in the SDK, rights object (DRC) must be
  loaded first using File-Open, before the content (DCF), unlike in S60
  devices.
- DRC (Digital Rights) content cannot be 'pushed' to the SDK from NMIT
  (Nokia Mobile Internet Toolkit). Instead save DRC content in NMIT by
  using the Save Binary option, and then File-Open them using the SDK.

Emulator Applications
---------------------  
- Camera is not supported by S60 Emulator.
- Smart message sending of the following items do not work in the 
  emulator.
  - Phonebook (contacts)
  - Calendar (calendar items)

Web Run-Time and Widget support
-------------------------------
- The included version of Web Run-Time is not final. It is useful for
  familiarizing yourself with Web Run-Time and widget writing, but 
  widget tested using this emulator might not run unmodified in the 
  devices. Please check the Forum Nokia Web site regularly for news 
  on an SDK with a newer version of Web Run-Time.

Emulator -> Tools
-----------------
- Diagnostics -> Drives - RAM Consumption is not happening when open 
  any Memory Eater Applications on Device 
- Diagnostics -> MIDlet System.out Redirection: System output has 100 
  character buffer, and can not be seen before the buffer is full.
- Events -> Enhancement Events -> Handsfree mode on/off event does not 
  work. 
- The emulator fails to start if very large values are configured in 
  the Preferences 'Memory Capacity' setting (192M or more depending on 
  environment). oo high value can be reset by editing the epoc.ini file
  in bin\epoc32\data\epoc.ini and changing the MegabytesOfFreeMemory 
  setting to a lower value. Eg. the default 32.
- Preferences -> MIDP Security - "Ask once" is not working correctly for
  User Defined:Messaging.
- Utilities -> Removable Drive is not always detected

UEI, IDEs and development
-------------------------
The SDK supports integration with following IDEs:
- NetBeans 5.5 with NetBeans Mobility Pack 5.5
  - debugging does not work if Examples are imported from previous SDKs.
    The project definition format has changed from NetBeans 5.0 and the
    current SDK does not contain new project files for NetBeans 5.5.
    SOLUTION: Create as a new project, import sources from existing
    project.
- Eclipse 3.2.2 with EclipseME 1.7.5 or later is recommended
  - Emulator supports debugger in server mode. To keep the debug server
    start-up delay setting (in EclipseME) as short as possible, it is
    recommended to first run the MIDlet under development, exit the
    MIDlet and leave the emulator running. This functionality may change
    in future versions of EclipseME.
- During development, the DebugAgent can occasionally fail to clean a
  previously installed instance of a MIDlet if the emulator window is
  closed when the MIDlet is running. When the MIDlet is run again, the
  condition is identified by "Symbian error code: -5" -error dialog.
  SOLUTION: Click "Abort" in "SDK Progress" -window, close emulator and
  re-run the MIDlet.
- UEI interface reports ("emulator.exe -version") lists wrong APIs.
  Correct list can be configured in both Eclipse and NetBeans by user.


JSR 135: Mobile Media API
-------------------------
- Problems may occur when developing Java applications which use 
  multimedia, e.g. problems when creating sound loops or controlling tune
  timing in mobile Java games or when playing video streaming over rtsp 
  protocol by mobile Java.
- Some media formats are not available in the emulator.

  Workarounds:
  - use S60 device hardware (S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1 and 2) for testing
  - use S60 3rd Edition SDK for Symbian OS, for MIDP


JSR 234: Advanced Multimedia Supplements
----------------------------------------
- Problems may occur when developing Java applications which use 3D 
  audio, e.g. 3D sound direction, pitch or reverb may not be heard 
  correctly.
 
  Workarounds:
  - use S60 device hardware (S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1 and 2) for testing

JSR 226: Scalable 2D Vector Graphics API for J2ME™ 1.1
------------------------------------------------------
- M2GSVGElement.setPathTrait() can fail.

JSR 205: Wireless Messaging API 2.0
-----------------------------------
- MessageConnection.MULTIPART_MESSAGE attribute is missing.

Documentation
-------------
- Some IDEs cannot find the Javadoc API documentation provided with the
  SDK. Workaround: Java API Javadocs are packaged per JSR under the 
  directory S60_3rd_MIDP_FP2\doc\ and can be accessed from index.html
- Java API Javadocs contain broken links to files and anchors that
  are not part of the documentation package.
- JSR 118 MIDP 2.1 JavaDocs are not included.

Example applications
--------------------
- The SDK does not contain any example MIDlets.

S60 Tools
---------
- EcmtAgent_MIDP.sis is not signed. The EcmtAgent_MIDP.sis can be
  self-signed with development keys, and then used only for diagnostics.
  On-device debugging is not supported.
- SIP Server Emulator can only be run in a two or more PCs
  configuration.
  PC1: S60 Emulator running Client application using SIP
  PC2: S60 Emulator running Client application using SIP
  SIP Server emulator running on PC1 or dedicated PC.
  SIP Invitation can only be sent from PC2. SIP Server Emulator fails
  to register invitations coming from S60 Emulator running on same PC
  as the Server Emulator.
- SIP Configuration: both SIP Registrar and SIP Proxy servers need to
  be configured. Note that Proxy configuration is a mandatory step.
  Otherwise SIP Server emulator connection can't be made.
