dealing with fscommand launch
When it comes 2 way communication between Flash Lite and other applications the more effective way to do this is by running a local server on the device and then using loadVariables or even XMLsocket to talk to the native app. Although theres no point having a local server listen out for FL calls if FL isn't even running. So fscommand is again crucial here as a the starting point of communication.
